# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Developed a Rock Paper Scissors game using Python

**GAME RULES :** A classic two-person game. Players start each round by selecting, “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player holds out their fist for rock, flat hand for paper, or their index and middle finger for scissors. Here computer and a user will be the players, selecting Rock Paper or Scissors each time. Winners will be according to these basic rules: Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper covers rock. And if both computer and user makes the same choice then the game ends to a tie.
